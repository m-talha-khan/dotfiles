Current daily driver is arch linux, always backup for your file before replacing my dotfiles. Take a look under zsh folder those two files are most important

Also if you are python developer the vimrc and plugins are configure especially for it My workflow is about 89 percent in the terminal, There are so many alias in my zsh folder go though them not, just copy and paste One of the alias need a software to be install (expac)

last-install='expac --timefmt='''%Y-%m-%d %T''' '''%l\t%n''' | sort | tail -n 20'

The above command will list about 20 last install packages
